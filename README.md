# Onitama

So back in high school (2019) I made this terrible implementation of a cool board game by Arcane Wonders called Onitama. The game is really cool and you should check it out. Anyways, you can run the program and play solo (horrible AI) or with a friend (locally, taking turns on the same PC). The code is all written in one file. And when you open it, you'll see some nasty cooking. And it ain't momma's fried chicken. You've never seen spaghetti this messy, I can tell you that. Nonetheless, it works. 

So I'll put this up as a memory. A time before all the stuff that happened. To some nicer times. Y'know before the corona and earthquakes and before my heart broke into pieces and up and down and underneath it all. Just miss the colors from back then. But I'll see some colors again. As long as there's hope he'll return, I won't quit. Love ya.
